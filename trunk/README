Introduction
=============

JsQT is a tool to compile QTDesigner's .ui files to javascript code, 
which is initially targeted to work with the qooxdoo framework.

It's still in its early stages of development, yet some promising
results could be obtained for simple cases.

What follows is practically the only documentation about the project.
I hope that more will follow.

Tutorial
=========

To get the sample .ui file working, you need to go over the following
steps:

1. Download Qooxdoo source development kit from www.qooxdoo.org and 
   unzip it to a path to your liking. Then create a sample qooxdoo 
   project. Set the root namespace to be "sample". The documentation 
   on how to do it can be found at: 

       http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.8/helloworld
   
2. Go to the JsQT root directory and run:

       python src/main.py xml class sample

   You'll see a directory named "class". Put its contents to 
   source/class directory in your Qooxdoo project root.

3. The generated class is named "sample.draw.Add". You can paste the
   following code to the source/class/sample/Application.js:

       var sample_form = new sample.draw.Add();
       var doc = this.getRoot();
       doc.add(sample_form.getWidget(), {edge:0});

   You should remove the default code from the Qooxdoo skeleton, if it
   is still there.

4. Run:

        ./generate.py source

   in the qooxdoo directory. For details on how to do it, refer to the
   helloworld documentation above.
       
5. Point your browser to source/index.html to see the results.
