Introduction
=============

JsQT is a tool to compile QTDesigner's .ui files to javascript code, 
which is initially targeted to work with the qooxdoo framework.

Quoting the Qooxdoo web site:

    qooxdoo is a comprehensive and innovative Ajax application 
    framework. Leveraging object-oriented JavaScript allows 
    developers to build impressive cross-browser applications. No 
    HTML, CSS nor DOM knowledge is needed.

    It includes a platform-independent development tool chain, a 
    state-of-the-art GUI toolkit and an advanced client-server 
    communication layer. It is open source under an LGPL/EPL dual 
    license.

So it's an exciting javascript framework library to work with. It is 
being actively developed by a friendly community.

JsQT is still in its early stages of development, yet some promising
results can be obtained for simple cases.
