Introduction
=============

JsQt is a tool to compile QtDesigner's .ui files to javascript code,
which is initially targeted to work with the qooxdoo framework.

Quoting the Qooxdoo web site:

    qooxdoo is a comprehensive and innovative Ajax application 
    framework. Leveraging object-oriented JavaScript allows 
    developers to build impressive cross-browser applications. No
    HTML, CSS nor DOM knowledge is needed.

    It includes a platform-independent development tool chain, a 
    state-of-the-art GUI toolkit and an advanced client-server 
    communication layer. It is open source under an LGPL/EPL dual 
    license.

So it's an exciting javascript framework library to work with. It is 
being actively developed by a friendly community.

There's still a lot of remaining work to support QtDesigner's feature
set, yet some promising results can be obtained for a number of
frequent use cases cases.


Installation
=============

Just run:

    python setup.py install

in a shell with root privileges, (this means you may need to prefix the
above command with sudo) inside the package root directory. The setup
script will generate two executables, namely "jsqt" and "jsuic".

Usage
======

Head over to

    http://code.google.com/p/jsqt/wiki/Tutorial

to see how to create javascript code from the sample xml files that can
be found inside test/xml/draw directory.

Of the two resulting executables, jsqt is the main executable whose
functionality is described in the above website, and jsuic is the tool
that seeks to implement an interface similar to the popular pyuic and
uic tools. It takes a single .ui file as argument, and prints the
resulting qooxdoo class to stdout.
